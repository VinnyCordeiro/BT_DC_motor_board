- 2025-02-01:
  - Revision 1.0: board only using Raspberry Pi Pico as the MCU
- 2025-02-02:
  - Revision 1.1:
    - added CAN bus support by adding a connector for a CAN transceiver module and additional support circuitry
  - Revision 2.0:
    - added support for the Black Pill STM32F401 MCU
    - added circuitry to select between USB power and buck converter power
- 2025-02-03:
  - Revision 2.1:
    - first publicly available revision
    - made some corrections on silkscreen
    - added the necessary CERN Licence information
  - Revision 2.2:
    - added a fuse
    - created file documenting the pinout
  - Revision 2.3:
    - corrected a flaw that could blow a USB port when the board tries to power the DC motors from USB
    - formatted CHANGES.md a little better
    - added a note informing that the design is still untested
- 2025-02-04:
  - added a tentative config file
- 2025-02-05:
  - corrected info about the fuse
  - added fuse 3D model
- 2025-02-22:
  - Revision 2.4:
    - bigger footprint for the CAN terminator resistor
    - the diameter of the holes for the sockets that hold the Raspberry Pi Pico now matches the ones for the Black Pill for a snugger fit, that helps when soldering
    - SW6 changed pin on the Black Pill, now being PB1; the previous pin is shared with the on-board LED and that could lead to strange behavior
