- 2025-02-01:
  - Revision 1.0: board only using Raspberry Pi Pico as the MCU
- 2025-02-02:
  - Revision 1.1:
    - added CAN bus support by adding a connector for a CAN transceiver module and additional support circuitry
  - Revision 2.0:
    - added support for the Black Pill STM32F401 MCU
    - added circuitry to select between USB power and buck converter power
- 2025-02-03:
  - Revision 2.1:
    - first publicly available revision
    - made some corrections on silkscreen
    - added the necessary CERN Licence information
  - Revision 2.2:
    - added a fuse
    - created file documenting the pinout
  - Revision 2.3:
    - corrected a flaw that could blow a USB port when the board tries to power the DC motors from USB
    - formatted CHANGES.md a little better
    - added a note informing that the design is still untested
- 2025-02-04:
  - added a tentative config file
- 2025-02-05:
  - corrected info about the fuse
  - added fuse 3D model
- 2025-02-22:
  - Revision 2.4:
    - bigger footprint for the CAN terminator resistor
    - the diameter of the holes for the sockets that hold the Raspberry Pi Pico now matches the ones for the Black Pill for a snugger fit, that helps when soldering
    - SW6 changed pin on the Black Pill, now being PB1; the previous pin is shared with the on-board LED and that could lead to strange behavior
- 2025-02-25:
  - Revision 2.5:
    - corrected the footprint for both the 24V to 5V and the DRV8837 modules
    - added a source for a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 clone on the BOM
    - uploaded Rev. 2.5 Gerber files
- 2025-03-03:
  - Revision 2.6:
    - corrected the footprint for the 24V to 5V buck converter module again: Aliexpress finally delivered it and I could use it on a printed mock-up to get the real dimensions (as originally I was only guessing it using photos as a reference. It was pretty close, but innacurate enough so I had to change it)
    - changed the switch for 5V source selection for a model that has both a smaller footprint and a bigger current capacity
    - changed all hole diameters for pin sockets
  - Revision 2.6.1:
    - adjusted some silkscreen markings
    - uploaded updated Gerber files
